Create a Vite React TypeScript app.
It works mobile first.

There are 5 rows for these materials:

Ceramics
Chemicals
Metals
Resins
Special Alloys

There are buttons with available sizes for them like this:

Ceramics [40] [80] [160] [320] [480] [640] [800]
Chemicals [30] [60] [120] [240] [360] [480] [600]
Metals [50] [100] [200] [400] [600] [800] [1000]
Resins [40] [80] [160] [320] [480] [640] [800]
Special Alloys [60] [120] [240] [480] [720] [960] [1200]

When a button is clicked, its marked as active and counted. There's total value visible as well:

Ceramics [40] [2 x 80] [160] [320] [1 x 480] [640] [800] (total: 640)
Chemicals [30] [60] [120] [240] [360] [480] [600]
Metals [50] [100] [200] [400] [600] [800] [1000]
Resins [40] [80] [160] [320] [480] [640] [800]
Special Alloys [60] [120] [240] [480] [720] [960] [1200]

The values should also be a way to unclick a button.
